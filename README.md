## Rules for contributors

The system is developed using the MCCE Turbo Pascal 3.3f for MSX machines, but 
code made with any other Pascal compilers available for MSX, like the HiSoft 
Pascal are welcome but just will be accepted on repository, if the code keeps the 
compatibility with Turbo Pascal 3.3f compiler, and following our directories 
structure.
Another restriction is about the use of non open source code GPLv3. All code are
written and released under this license, so if you're sending code based on closed
source or even using another restrict license your code won't be accepted in our main 
branch.
